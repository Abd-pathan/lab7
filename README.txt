The source code in the file apathan_lab7.c is the code.
Basically in the program we are doing the file operations using fork() method.

Program flow explain-

The program first takes the user input for opening the file and then it creates the 
child process using fork() method.

The child process then executes the input file and then dislpays then output
meanwhile the parent process is measuring the time taken in execution of the
commands of input file.
